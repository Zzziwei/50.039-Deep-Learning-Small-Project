# Description 
This project is a class project for SUTD's Deep Learning course. 

In this project, we are tasked to propose, train and design a Deep Learning model to classify X-ray images of patients and help doctors with the diagnosis of COVID/non-COVID pneumonia. 

# File Descriptions
1. Run codes in Latest_File.ipynb for our proposed models.
2. Dataset and Dataloader.ipynb only contains desciptions of the dataset.
3. Report.pdf contains clear documentations on the choices that we have made for the proposed model.
