# Description 
This project is a class project for SUTD's Deep Learning course. 

In this project, we are tasked to propose, train and design a Deep Learning model to classify X-ray images of patients and help doctors with the diagnosis of COVID/non-COVID pneumonia. 

# File Descriptions
1. Run codes in *Latest_File.ipynb* for our proposed models. To successfully run the code, please have *Latest_File.ipynb* and *saved_model.pth* to be in the same folder with *./dataset* folder.
2. *Dataset and Dataloader.ipynb* contains only analysis of the dataset.
3. *Report.pdf* contains clear documentations on the choices that we have made for the proposed model.
4. *saved_model.pth* is the weights of the model that we have trained. This will be used in the *Latest_File.ipynb* when loading the model.
